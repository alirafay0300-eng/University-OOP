# University-OOP
📘 C++ OOP Lab — Structures, Loops & Functions

This repository contains my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Lab tasks written in C++.
The project covers the basics of:

✔️ Structures

✔️ Loops

✔️ Functions

✔️ Input/Output handling

✔️ Basic modular program design

The code includes problem-solving exercises required for university OOP practice.

🚀 Project Overview

This lab project starts from basic structure creation, then moves into using loops with structures, and ends with functions that process structured data.

The main goals of the programs include:

Defining and using struct

Storing multiple records using arrays

Using loops to input and display data

Writing functions to process the structure (print, search, modify, etc.)

Following clean, modular coding principles

🧱 Topics Covered
1️⃣ Structures

Examples include:

Creating a structure

Declaring structure variables

Using structures inside functions

Array of structures

2️⃣ Loops

for, while, do-while loops

Iterating through structure arrays

Searching and printing information

3️⃣ Functions

Passing structures to functions

Returning structures

Using functions for modularity (e.g., input, display, calculations)

📁 Project Structure

Example layout:

🛠 How to Run (Mac / Windows / Linux)
Compile

Run
./program

📌 Requirements

C++ Compiler (g++, clang++, MinGW, etc.)

Basic understanding of OOP fundamentals

📄 Example Code Snippet
struct Student {
    string name;
    int age;
    float marks;
};

void printStudent(Student s) {
    cout << "Name: " << s.name << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << s.age << endl;
    cout << "Marks: " << s.marks << endl;
}

📜 Purpose

This repository is created for university OOP lab submissions and personal revision.
It helps in practicing structured programming and building a foundation for advanced OOP concepts.
